editorialNote: The main paper (kostov2017towards) presents just part of the Aviation Ontology (diagram 1). Other part of the same model can be found in ahmad2016ontological, which was reproduced in diagram 2. The Safety Ontology is represented in diagram3. When a class' stereotype is not present in one diagram but can be found in another we represent it in both diagrams. Associations originally represented as bound were represented separated.
